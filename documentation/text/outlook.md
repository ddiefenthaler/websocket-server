## Outlook

Like many other projects this program is far from fully finished.
Throughout this documentation there were references what could still be done.
Mostly just little experiments with performance and practicality.

Additionally a more creative program name would be nice as websocket-server is pretty generic.
Together with that a build system that sets appropriate default locations
for configuration and PID files is still missing as well.

Overall this program was developed to create a simple to use WebSocket server.
It is unclear if this program will ever be used in a productive system.
But it was a nice learning experience nevertheless.
